									<h2 id="About_Rush">What is Rush?</h2>
									<p>Rush is a week-long event where fraternities and sororities invite students 
									to check out what they have to offer. Rush typically takes place the week 
									before classes start.</p><br>
									<h2 id="Why_Rush">Why should I Rush?</h2>
									<p>Rush is an excellent way to meet new people, to have a good time, and get some 
									free food. Even if you aren't sure that you want to join a fraternity, you should 
									still come out to Rush. "Rushing" for a fraternity in no way conscribes you 
									to join. It is purely a time for you to learn more about Zeta Beta Tau, our 
									members, and fraternity life in general. Rush is an experience nobody should 
									miss.</p><br>
									<h2 id="Is_Rush_Party">Is Rush just a big crazy party?</h2>
									<p>Though things may get "crazy" at times, <b>Rush is alcohol-free</b> 
									campus wide in accordance with Georgia Tech and IFC regulations. You can rest easy
									knowing that things will not get too far out of hand and that there will be absolutely
									no dangerous activities or situations that take place.</p><br>
									<h2 id="No_Hazing">What about hazing?</h2>
									<p>The government, Georgia Tech, IFC, and Zeta Beta Tau all have strict rules 
									prohibiting hazing of any kind at any time. Eliminating the pledge process 
									is one of many steps Zeta Beta Tau has taken to prevent this from ocurring. 
									Rush is dry and in no way does the fraternity ever expect you to do anything 
									with which you're uncomfortable.</p><br>
									<h2 id="ZBT_Process">How does the Rush process work at Zeta Beta Tau?</h2>
									<p>Towards the end of Rush, if the members of Zeta Beta Tau feel that you would make 
									a good addition to our fraternity, we will issue you a bid. The bid is a 
									written invitation to join our fraternity. If you accept the bid, we will then 
									accept you into our fraternity. After an initiation, you immediately become a full brother as 
									Zeta Beta Tau has abolished the pledge process completely. To date, Zeta Beta Tau is the only
									fraternity on the Georgia Tech campus to have done this.</p><br>
									<h2 id="Why_Fraternity">Why join a fraternity?</h2>
									<p>A fraternity is a brotherhood that lasts forever. Your brothers are more 
									than your friends-- they'll stick by you and help guide you throughout college 
									and the rest of your life.</p><br>
									<h2 id="Fraternity_Grades">Will joining Zeta Beta Tau harm my grades?</h2>
									<p>No. Fraternity life is secondary to getting an education. Georgia Tech is a hard 
									school, no matter what major, meaning that every brother in the fraternity has 
									to study just as you do. It is a proven fact that members of fraternities at Georgia Tech 
									have consistently had a higher GPA than non-greek students. This is typically attributed to the
									amount of academic resources that most fraternities have at their disposal, such as a large array of members
									across all majors and classes that can provide aid. Zeta Beta Tau is required by the IFC to maintain a satisfactory average GPA
									which has led to things such as weekly mandatory study hours at the library and a large physical and digital database of past coursework
									donated by brothers, such as tests, quizzes, and homework.</p><br>
									<h2 id="Why_ZBT"> Why Zeta Beta Tau?</h2>
									<p>Every fraternity will tell you they're different. This is true to some extent. 
									That is why it is important to find one you feel you connect with. Zeta Beta Tau is 
									a brotherhood of men with excellent values, leadership abilities, responsibility, 
									and exemplary character. There has rarely been a better time to join Zeta Beta Tau as we 
									are currently in the process of rebuilding our fraternity. To join now means that you will
									play a part in the redifining of Zeta Beta Tau at Georgia Tech and shape it in your own way. Our brotherhood
									will become your own as you grow and develop into an exceptional individual alongside your brothers.
									Beyond this, we posses an extensive network of alumni that stretches across the globe and that
									can provide opportunities to both current brothers and other alumni.</p><br>
									<h2 id="ZBT_Expensive">Is Zeta Beta Tau expensive?</h2>
									<p>Zeta Beta Tau manages to be fairly inexpensive, compared to some fraternities at Georgia Tech, and yet still provide a great value.
									Each semester, Zeta Beta Tau provides many events and activities for its brothers, paid for with these dues. Our rent is also less 
									expensive than any Georgia Tech housing alternative. All brothers, whether they live in the house or not, have access to the house's kitchen, living room, chapter room, and other common areas. In a 3-4 year undergraduate experience in Zeta Beta Tau, many brothers end up spending much less compared to their peers. If you are considering Zeta Beta Tau and would find these expenses difficult for you or your family, feel free to confidentially contact our treasurer, <a href=mailto:treasurer@techzbt.com>Ian Moreno</a>. He can work out payment plans and other ways to make it possible for Zeta Beta Tau to be financially acceptable for you.</p><br>
									<h2 id="Rolling_Rush">What if Rush is over? Can I still join?</h2>
									<p>Of course. While Rush is the best time to join because we are in full recruitment 
									mode, Zeta Beta Tau is extremely motivated in building our numbers and is delighted 
									to invite you to any and every one of our public events. Just contact 
									our recruitment chair, <a href="mailto:rush@techzbt.com">Graeme Sharpe</a>, for more info.</p><br>
									<h2 id="More_Info">Who should I contact for more information?</h2>
									<p>You may contact our recruitment chair, <a href="mailto:rush@techzbt.com">Graeme Sharpe</a>. Also, you may contact our president, <a href="mailto:president@techzbt.com">Adam Berlinghoff</a>.</p><br>
