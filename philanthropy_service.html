								<h2>Children's Miracle Network Hospitals</h2>
									<p>At the summer 2002 meeting of the ZBT Supreme Council in Pittsburgh, Pa., Children's Miracle Network Hospitals was named the official adopted philanthropy of Zeta Beta Tau Fraternity.</p>

									<h4>Reasons why CMNH was adopted as our philanthropy</h4>
										<p>There are more than 170 CMN Hospitals nationwide with one being within driving distance of all ZBT chapters and colonies. Brothers can actually see the difference they are making in their communities by visiting their local CMN Hospital. Adopting a national charity provides our brothers with a common cause to work for and allows them to team up regionally to perform fundraising projects. ZBT is the fifth Greek-letter organization to partner with CMNH allowing our Brothers a chance to collaborate with other Greeks for a good cause. This relationship provides our undergraduates with a chance to learn valuable civic responsibilities and program planning skills. CMNH is known nationally for its dedication and support of children across the world.</p>

									<h4>About Children's Miracle Network Hospitals</h4>
										<p>Children's Miracle Network Hospitals raises funds for 170 children's hospitals across North America, which, in turn, use the money where it's needed the most. When a donation is given it stays in the community, ensuring that every dollar is helping local kids. Since 1983, Children's Miracle Network Hospitals has raised more than $4.3 billion, most of it $1 at a time. These donations have gone to support research and training, purchase equipment, and pay for uncompensated care, all in support of our mission to save an improve the lives of as many children as possible.</p>

								<h2>Get on the Ball</h2> 

									<p>Get on the Ball was started by the brothers of the Beta Zeta Epsilon Chapter at the University of Maryland â€“ College Park. Designed to create a fun, worthwhile way of raising funds for charity, this event quickly became not only a chapter favorite, but also something that the campus community at the university looked forward to each year.In its simplest form, Get on the Ball is the process of rolling a ball six feet in diameter around campus to collect signatures for a chosen charity (or charities). Funds can be raised through a number of ways, including:

										Pledges from surrounding businesses to donate a set amount of money per signature on the ball.
										Donations from businesses to sponsor the event.
										Donations to specific areas of the event such as T-shirts or the purchase of the ball.
										Donations from individual signees at the time of signing the ball.

									The event usually lasts around a full week.</p>
